<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a web developer. I also love cooking, reading and travelling in my spare time.
  Coding showed me a new path to life and a new sense of direction.
  it's my safe space. I started learning to code as a hobby but recently,
  I'm seeking  for more knowledge and strength in web Development so as
  to make a living out of it too. 
</p>

<p>It isn't an easy feat to achieve but then there's really nothing
  easy in life right?. I've giving up countless of times, I barely get
  any support or encouragement from my family because they feel I'm just
  wasting my time, but at the end it is 'He who gives up that is a failure'.
</p>

<p>I encourage everyone who is looking to take up a hobby or a career
  path in any tech related field, it might not be easy, most times it
  might seem as if you've lost your path or can't see where you're headed,
  But that's just the process. The process is usually the toughest but
  the outcome is bigger than your can ever imagine. Just hangon there 
  an keep pushing! It only gets better!
